E

The E Project is designed to be a system, that runs on Linux, to provide
cryptographic protection to certain communications with best confidentiality and
plausible deniability.

Like GnuPG and OpenSSL, E runs under shell with commands like:

1) e encrypt --file PLAINTEXT --key KEYFILE [--output OUTPUT FILE]
2) e decrypt --file CIPHERTEXT --key KEYFILE [--output OUTPUT FILE]
